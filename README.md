#title Learning R in 2022
---

## Motivation

Up to now, I still couldn't believe how many languages I need to learn but also I started to notice the differences between programming languages such as in R,Python, JavaScript and Java. It isn't because I love to learn many lanuages but sometimes it's no options. I recently get a job which requires me to learn R. I have some experience in learning R back to my master's degree study in univeristy 3 years ago. That was the time I didn't know how to code. Now I'm at the much better position to learn R. 

I think normally, people would just go for crash courses and kind of getting their heads around the new language environments. To some degree, I think there must be a better approach. Can we use known factors to solve unknown? It's a classic mathematical thinking. 

## Roadmap
1. How to do basic arithmetic operation
2. How to evaluate conditions
3. How to leveage logical operator with conditions
---Once you understand them above you can think about variables and datatypes--
4. How to assign variables
5. What are primitive data types in R?
6. What are built-in data structures in R?
---Once you know these above, you can think about branching, loops, functions and scopes---
7. How to write branching?
8. How to write a loop?
9. How to write a function?


5. Data type


In R, unlike other programming language such as Java or C, variables aren't declared as certain data types. Instead, variables are assigned with certain R objects and the data types of the R objects "inherently" become variables'.

### R objects

- vectors
- lists
- matrices
- arrays
- factors
- data frames
