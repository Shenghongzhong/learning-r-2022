# Data Scientist with R 


## Motivation

Up to now, I still couldn't believe how many languages I need to learn but also I started to notice the differences between programming languages such as in R,Python, JavaScript and Java. It isn't because I love to learn many lanuages but sometimes it's no options. I recently get a job which requires me to learn R. I have some experience in learning R back to my master's degree study in univeristy 3 years ago. That was the time I didn't know how to code. Now I'm at the much better position to learn R. 
I think normally, people would just go for crash courses and kind of getting their heads around the new language environments. To some degree, I think there must be a better approach. Can we use known factors to solve unknown? It's a classic mathematical thinking. 
Lots of time, we tend to think big. Maybe, it's too big. However, the way I'm going to lead this project is agile. 
That is, product first and iteration later.  

With a little planning and crazy execution, I think it'll work.

## Execution Plan

Step 1 : I gather information and learn them all

Step 2 : I create tutorials

Step 3:  I post them raw on Slack and record & post them on Youtube 

Step 4: I review them on the weekend and evaluate them and give feedback

Step 5: I recreate a certain number of videos

Step 6: I will start runnig livestream if I can successed above
